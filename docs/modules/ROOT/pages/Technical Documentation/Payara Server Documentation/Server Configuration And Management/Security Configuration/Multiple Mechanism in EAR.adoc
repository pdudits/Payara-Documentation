= Multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanisms in EAR Application
:ordinal: 2

Within the Security API specification, an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` can be defined to retrieve the user credentials from the HTTP Request. These credentials are then used by any configured identity stores to validate the user.

However, a restriction of the Security API specification is that only one `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` can be defined per application. This restriction is also in place for EAR applications file where it's possible to have multiple web modules.

Payara Server allows to circumvent this restriction so that multiple authentication mechanisms are used in an EAR application that hosts more than one Web module. To this effect, each web module must configure its own authentication mechanism separately.

IMPORTANT: In order to use this feature, there must not be any custom `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` implementations bundled in any of the modules hosted in the EAR artifact. If this is the case, the feature will not work as intended.

NOTE: This behaviour is specific to the Payara Platform and not compatible with the Jakarta Security specification.

== How to Configure

In order to configure a specific `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` for a Web application, define the `fish.payara.security.mechanism` parameter in the _web.xml_ deployment descriptor like in the following case:

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>fish.payara.security.mechanism</param-name>
    <param-value>JWT</param-value>
</context-param>
----

The following mechanisms can be used:

[cols="2,10", options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description
|Basic |Use _BasicAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Form |Use _FormAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|CustomForm | Use _CustomFormAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|JWT | Use the custom Payara _JWTAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Certificate | Use the custom Payara _CertificateAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|OAuth2 |Use the custom Payara _OAuth2AuthenticationMechanism_ or provider-specifc one, such as `AzureOpenIdAuthenticationMechanism` or `_GoogleOpenIdAuthenticationMechanism_` as mechanism.
|<any Fully Qualified Class Name> |Use the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` indicated by the class name.
|===

NOTE: When no parameter is specified, the standard rules of the Security API are active (only 1 allowed per artifact).
